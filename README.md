#NextJs Basics

##Description
this repository contains the basic setup of [NextJs](https://nextjs.org/). I have not doing anything on it yet and you can have this setup by running following command:

```md
npx create-next-app@latest .
```
by executing this command on your terminal, you can have this setup on your current folder.

##Usage
In order to use this template and see the result, you should first build it in the created directory by `npm run build`. then after finishing build you can start the project with `npm start` and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` on your browser.
